# NEETPrepGPT Foundation 🚀  
_The Core Python & Dev Environment Phase of the MedEd-AI Builder Journey_

## 🔰 Overview

This repository marks the **foundational "learn-by-doing" phase** of the **NEETPrepGPT** project — a core component of my bold mission to revolutionize education using AI. This phase is dedicated to mastering **core Python skills** and **development environment best practices**, which will serve as the engine behind all future AI tools and intelligent applications.

---

## 🧭 Guiding Principle

> **“Learn by Doing”** — Every concept learned is implemented directly into real-world project components.

---

## 📚 What This Covers

This phase rigorously covers the following topics critical to intelligent medical tool development:

### 🔹 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism  
- Abstraction & Encapsulation  
- Writing **modular**, **scalable**, and **reusable** code  
- Foundation for future **AI Agents** and **LangChain-based frameworks**

### 🔹 2. Data Structures
- Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets  
- Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs  
- Crucial for handling structured NEET datasets & building search/extract tools  

### 🔹 3. Asynchronous I/O (Async IO)
- Mastering `asyncio`, `await`, and event loops  
- Key for **web scraping**, **API calls**, and **responsive AI systems**

### 🔹 4. Decorators
- Functional enhancements  
- Used in **FastAPI**, **logging**, **auth**, **timing**, and **monitoring**

### 🔹 5. Git & GitHub Mastery
- Version control: `clone`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `branch`, `merge`, `rebase`  
- Collaborative workflows via **GitHub PRs & Issues**

### 🔹 6. PEP 8 Compliance
- Consistent code styling using **Black** & **flake8**  
- Improves **maintainability**, **readability**, and **team collaboration**

### 🔹 7. Virtual Environment Setup (venv)
- Isolated environments per project  
- Prevents dependency conflicts & ensures **reproducibility**
